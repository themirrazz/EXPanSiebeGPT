===================== THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRITTEN IN THE FAKINNA-ECRYPT LANGUAGE =====================
Fakinna is a secret, constantly evolving language that can easily be translated to and from English with
simple logic. Any "ti" sound is changed to "shi", "x" is changed to "kosu". Any verb gets a "ru" added on the end.
If the verb ends with a constanant or "y", "aru" is added.
Examples: "Run" is now "runaru", however "die" is just "dieru".
Every noun that starts with "se" must be changed to "fne". This language uses a secret alphabet system in addition:
